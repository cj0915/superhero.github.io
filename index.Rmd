### **Motivation**

The superhero universe is rich with complex characters who embody a wide range of skills, powers, and moral alignments. This project aims to explore the attributes and dynamics of superheroes and villains, drawing comparisons between their strengths, weaknesses, affiliations, and other characteristics. Finally, We will build an interactive tool where users can input their desired weight of each capability, such as intelligence, strength, or power, to find heroes and villains that match their preferences. This feature will allow superhero comic fanatics to explore characters based on personalized criteria, creating a more engaging and customizable experience.
